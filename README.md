Problem Statement: There is an education company called X Education which sells online courses to Industry Professionals. The company currently market its offerings on several online websites and search engines like Google.

Whenever, the person browses through their offering, the company asked to fill in the online form with their interest and their email address or phone number. Once the person fills such forms, they then treated as Lead for the company. Apart from this, the company also gets some Leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X Education is around 30%.

Now Company wants to make this process more efficient, and wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target Lead conversion rate to be around 80% compared to current 30%.

Step 1: Setting Up the Environment
